# Fancy charts and dashboards - customizing Oracle Jet in APEX

Repository contains demo application that I have used in presentation "Fancy charts and dashboards - customizing Oracle Jet in APEX".
Presetation was given:
- at DOAG2019 conference in Nuremberg, Germany (November 19 - 22, 2019)
- at Apex Connect 2020, on-line (May 5 - 6, 2020) 
- at POUG2020 hybrid conference in Warsaw, Poland and on-line (Semptember 11 - 12, 2020)

Demo app was exported from APEX v.20.1. and for proper working requires running DDL and DML sql scripts.
